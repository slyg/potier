# Flux/React app using brunch and ES6

## Setup

#### Prerequisites

- use iojs > 2.0.0 (you may use `n` globally installed, e.g. `n use iojs 2.0.0`)
- bower globally installed (`npm install bower -g`)

#### Install dependencies

`npm install`

#### Start the application

`npm start`

Port is set to `3000` by default, however you can change it in `config/all.json`.

## Dev mode

Dev mode allows you to modify sources while reloading the application. I'd recommend to use chrome as browser for dev.

`npm run dev`

Server restarts on server files changes and client-side resources live reload is activated by default.

For other commands listing, use `npm run`.
